Drug Diffusion Through Tissue Simulator

An interactive biomedical engineering model that visualizes how drugs diffuse into tissue over time, based on Fick’s second law of diffusion.

🔬 Relevance to Biomedical Engineering

Drug delivery is a cornerstone of biomedical research, with direct applications in transdermal patches, implantable devices, and targeted therapies.
This simulator demonstrates how transport phenomena (diffusion, concentration gradients, and tissue thickness) influence drug penetration — linking chemical engineering principles with biomedical applications.

🚀 How to Use

Adjust the sliders for diffusion coefficient, tissue thickness, and initial concentration.

Move the time slider to observe concentration profiles at different times.

The plot updates in real-time, showing how drugs spread through tissue.
